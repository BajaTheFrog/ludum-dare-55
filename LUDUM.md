# Ghostdusters

_Get dustin'!_

## Gameplay

You're a necromancer-in-training who must clean the Necromansion from naughty ghosts! Summon good ghostie helpers to clean, but BEWARE the consequences of over-summoning. Welcome to Ghostdusters.

- Smash **KEY COMBOS** to summon ghosts and **CLICK** on a dirty room to start their cleaning session. âŒ¨ðŸ–±
- The more ghosties you summon, the **CRAZIER** the key combos get. ðŸ¤ª
- Ghosts earn **STARS** for cleaning rooms! ðŸš¿
- But, if ghosties clean a room and are left too long, they **GET ANGRY** and start messing up other rooms of the house. Chase them away to stop them from **DESTROYING** the Necromansion! ðŸ˜ˆ

If all rooms are **DESTROYED**, you might have to go back to pickling newts instead.

## Controls

- **WASD** to move and summon
- **SPACE** to interact
- **CLICK** on a room to direct a ghost helper

## Freaky Tips & Tricks

- Only **ONE GHOST** can be in a room at a time
- Ghosts get **RESTLESS** if there's nothing to clean. Visit them to calm them and give more work.
- **ANGRY GHOSTS** flee if confronted enough times. Cowards!
